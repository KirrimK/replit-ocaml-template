# Ocaml-template

A simple template that allows programming with ocaml on replit.com.

---

If you want to add your own packages, try adding them by adding the opam package to the replit.nix file (setting up opam might be CPU intensive, I didn't test it to completion), or by adding the packages directly (some like menhir might already be in the NixOS packages, for examples in the ocamlPackages set).
